# Fantasy Football AI

A Python-based project designed to help optimize fantasy football drafting and weekly lineup decisions using machine learning and data from the **Sleeper API**.

## üöÄ Project Plan

This project aims to create an intelligent system that assists in fantasy football by:
1. **Draft Optimization** - Developing an algorithm to suggest the best players during the draft.
2. **Weekly Lineup Optimization** - Analyzing your current roster and suggesting the optimal lineup based on available players and matchups.
3. **Machine Learning** - Using statistical modeling and machine learning to improve player predictions and optimize strategies.

## üìä Current Stage

### 1. **Data Collection** (In Progress)
We are currently in the **data collection phase**, where we are:
- Connecting to the **Sleeper API** to retrieve player data, league settings, and other relevant information.
- Building the **data-fetching module** (`data_fetcher.py`) to regularly pull data from the API and save it for processing.

### 2. **Data Processing** (Planned)
Once we have the raw data, the next step will be to clean and format it into usable datasets. This step will involve:
- Filtering relevant player stats.
- Handling missing or incomplete data.
- Organizing the data into structures that will be used in the draft and lineup algorithms.

### 3. **Drafting Algorithm** (Planned)
After data processing, we will focus on building the algorithm that can:
- Suggest the best possible picks during a draft, based on player stats, position, and historical performance.

### 4. **Lineup Optimization** (Planned)
Lastly, we will implement an **optimization algorithm** that analyzes your current roster and suggests the best lineup for each week, based on matchups, player form, and other factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python** (for all development)
- **Pandas** (data manipulation and analysis)
- **Requests** (to interact with the Sleeper API)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms, when we move to predictive modeling)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for initial data analysis and experimentation)

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains all the Python code for fetching, processing, and analyzing data, as well as the algorithms for draft and lineup optimization.
- `data/` - Stores raw and processed data pulled from the Sleeper API.
- `models/` - Saved models after training for optimization purposes.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and data exploration.
- `tests/` - Unit tests to verify that all the functions and algorithms work correctly.

## üöß What‚Äôs Next?

- Completing the **data fetching and processing** modules.
- Implementing the **draft optimization algorithm** to make intelligent draft picks.
- Building the **lineup optimization system** to automatically suggest the best weekly lineup.
